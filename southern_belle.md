# Southern Belle 

###### Original: Invented by myself

Inspired by the Mint Julep, I tried to make a drink that is a different drink
that fits the same overall approach and glassware, (or metalware?).

## Scores
- Personal Taste: ****_
- Cost: $$$__
- Perceived Alcoholic Strength: !!___
- Real Alcoholic Strength: %%___

## Ingredients
- **Kentucky Straight Bourbon (1oz)**  
*Evan Williams is my favorite in general*
- **Cointreau (0.5oz)**  
*Any similar orange liqueur might do, but I think Cointreau is best for this*
- **Lemon Juice (0.5oz)**  
- **Club Soda (Can)**  
- **Lemon (Just one)**

## Directions
1. Fill Julep Cup with Ice
2. Pour all ingredients in, saving the club soda for last as a top-off
3. Stir for several seconds
4. Express some lemon zest oils over the drink
4. Garnish with a lemon twist

## Tips and Tricks
The best ice for this drink is if it is crushed in style, but still mostly into
big pieces.
