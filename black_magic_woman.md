# Black Magic Woman

###### Original: Invented by myself
    
There once was a girl. She was a seductress like non other I had ever met. 
She was trouble. She had me under a spell that I barely managed to escape. It 
was a Black Magic. She was a Black Magic Woman you know, like that Santana song.
Well anyways, here is a drink I made for her that she really seemed to like.

## Ingredients
- **Absinthe (1oz)**  
*I use Green Tree, but I don't really know much about Absinthe*
- **Creme de Bananes (1oz)**   
- **Cranberry Cocktail Juice (3oz)**   
*The measure is more of a guideline, add to taste*

## Directions
1. Add the Absinthe and Creme de Bananes over ice into a shaker
2. Stir, don't shake.
3. Strain into a Martini Glass
4. Top off with the Cranberry Juice (add to taste)
5. Drop in a dark cocktail cherry for ganish

## Tips and Tricks
Getting the balance of cranberry cocktail juice is really the trick, but 
unfortunately you'll have to find that right balance for yourself as it depends
on specifics. I've put 3oz mostly as a guidline. The aim is to add as much as 
you can without overpowering the principle ingredients.
