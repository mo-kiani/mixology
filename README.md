# Welcome to Mo's Cocktail Recipes

This is my personal repository of cocktail recipes

Some of the recipes you find here will be complete originals
Some other recipes will be my personal takes on well-known recipes
In some cases, I will leave a personal reference copy of an existing recipe
here to fine-tune the recipe later or to preserve a lesser known recipe in case
it were to disappear off the internet. I might also just keep some really
standard recipes here just to show how I like to make them, and that I do like
them!
