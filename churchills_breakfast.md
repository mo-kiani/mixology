## Ingredients
- **Rye Whiskey (1.5oz)**  
*I recommend Crown Royal's North Harvest*
- **Cold Brew Coffee (0.5oz)**  
*I recommend Stumptown*
- **Maple Syrup (0.25oz)**  
*Inventing in a high-end aged maple syrup can really make a huge difference*
- **Bitters (dashes)**  
*I recommend getting creative. Angostura is boring. Try Jack Rudy's Mole bitters
or Jerry Thomas's Bitter Truth*
- **Cinnamon (1 Stick)**  
- **(Optional)Cinnamon powder (just a tiny bit)**  


## Directions
1. Pour the Whiskey, Coffee, and Syrup into shaker over ice.
2. Shake vigorously for a short amount of time.
3. Set the shaker aside and move to the next steps
4. Place a Coupe glass upside-down on a plate
5. Take a cinnamon stick and torch one end until it lights on fire, sustaining
combustion on its own
6. Wait for the flame to burn a little bit.
7. Before the flame goes out, place the cinnamon on the plate with the burning
end underneath and inside the Coupe glass to collect the smoke
8. (Optional) Sprinkle some cinnamon powder into the Coupe Glass
9. Shake the shaker again, vigorously for a short amount of time.
10. Strain the drink into the Coupe glass
11. Drop the non-burnt end of the cinnamon into the drink, with the burnt end 
poking out.
12. Drop in a few dashes of your preferred bitters.


## Tips and Tricks
Right when the flame goes out is when most of the smoke is released from the
cinnamon stick. Make sure you do not miss the opportunity to catch it in the 
glass.
It will take a while to light the cinnamon, so try a blue jet lighter that
doesn't get too hot after prolonged use.  
Add a hint of cinnamon powder into the drink too, if you want to make sure you
get that cinnamon flavor in.
