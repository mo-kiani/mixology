# Flaming Bob Marley Shot

###### Modification: A substative modification to an existing drink
    
This is a drink I found on Tipsy Bartender. I really liked the idea of the
drink, but I found that the taste was not as good as it could be. I felt that 
the creme de menthe for the green part mixed with the grenadine gave it an
unpleasant candied cough syrup taste. Also, mixing the Bacardi 151 with the 
creme de menthe made preparation a bit harder than it had to be, especially
since you had to callibrate it just right for the green to float. What's more,
Bacardi 151 was starting to become hard to find in my location of BC, Canada due 
to regulations. So, I came up with a variation that takes care of those 
problems, and that has the added benefit of making the drink a bit stronger. Use
Absinthe instead, it's green, only one ingredient, already floats, had no
trouble lighting up, and makes the drink taste better IMHO.

## Ingredients
- **Grenadine (1/3 shot)**  
- **Galliano (1/3 shot)**  
- **Absinthe (1/3 shot)**  

## Directions
1. Pour in the Grenadine into a shot glass
*Avoid getting any on the inner wall of the shot glass. Keep it clean*
2. Carefully layer the Galliano on top of the Grenadine using a spoon
3. Similary to the Galliano, layer, the absinthe on top.
4. Use a lighter to light the absinthe up.

## Tips and Tricks
- Blue jet lighters are easier for lighting drinks since the flame shoots out 
rather than always point up, and they also burn hotter.  
- Wait until you are ready to serve/drink to light the drink up or else the
glass will get too hot and burn the drinker, or even damage the shot glass.
