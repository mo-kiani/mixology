This is a cool drink I found through Tipsy Bartender.
It's a super fun party shot, no need to say more.

## Ingredients
- **Peach Snapps (1oz)**  
- **Irish Cream (Bailey's) (0.5oz)**

## Directions
1. Add the Grenadine to a shot glass
2. Add the Peach Snapps to a shot glass
3. Carefully layer the Blue Curacao on top
4. Drop the Irish Cream in, so it pulls some of the curacao down with it, and
maybe 'wakes up' the grenadine a bit too.
