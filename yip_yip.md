# Yip-Yip

###### Original: Invented by myself

I once tried an amazing Vodka, called Zubrowka Bison Grass Vodka. So, I decided
to make a cocktail specifically designed around it as the base. I call it 
yip-yip in honor of my favorite Bison in all of fiction, Aang Airbender's trusty
and beloved Air Bison, Appa from Avatar the Last Airbender.
