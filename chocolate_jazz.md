# Chocolate Jazz

###### Original: Invented by myself

It's a cold wintery day outside and you want the perfect cozy hot chocolate that
will really warm you up inside, you know? But hot chocolate alone won't do.
Let's get a little creative with out liquor cabinet.

## Scores
- Personal Taste on a scale of 5 stars (*****)
- Cost on a scale of 5 dollar signs ($$$__)
- Perceived Alcoholic Strength on a scale of 5 exclamation marks (!____)
- Real Alcoholic Strength on a scale of 5 percent signs (%%___)

## Ingredients
- **Hot Chocolate Mix (enough to fill your cup/mug/bottle)**  
- **Milk (several ounces)**  
*Whole milk is probably best, to make it creamy*
- **Bacardi 151 or similar (3oz)**  
- **Bailey's or Godiva (1oz)**  
- **Creme de Coconut (1oz)**  
- **Creme de Menthe (0.5oz)**  
- **Marshmallows (several)**   

## Directions
1. Make Some Hot Chocolate
2. Add a few ounces of milk to it.
3. Add all other ingredients, except for 151 (or your substitute).
4. Stir gently for a bit.
5. Add more Bacardi 151 (or your substitute) until the strength is right for you
6. If you are using an open container, garnish it by dropping a few marshmellows
on top.

## Tips and Tricks

Keep the drink in a closed thermally insulated container. Firstly, this will 
keep your drink warm. Secondly, and I don't know how scientifically accurate 
this is, but I imagine it will slow down the evaporation of the liquor, which
is an issue since the drink is hot. A water bottle with insulation will do 
nicely.
